   * theme-tinted rim) already paints identically on every
   * surface, so no override is currently needed.
   *
   * Override rules should use a doubled-class selector
   * (`.myOverride.myOverride { ... }`) so they beat the base
   * `.ctaButton` specificity regardless of stylesheet import
   * order. The base styles deliberately keep specificity at
   * `(0,1,0)` so overrides only need `(0,2,0)` to win.

/**
 * Shared "Create your agent" CTA pill — the off-white registration
 * button used on the public chat surface and related public pages.
 *
 * Originally lived inline in `PublicChatView.tsx` as `.ctaButton`.
 * Extracted into its own component so the marketing `/product`
 * hero can mount the exact same pill underneath its headline
 * without forking the styles or duplicating the click handler.
 *
 * Theming
 * -------
 * The pill body (off-white fill, dark label, shimmer sweep) is a
 * constant on every surface. ONLY the rim border and the
 * three-layer outer bloom read the active accent hue from the
 * `--public-cta-glow-color` custom property and fall back to the
 * default neon-violet (`#9b5cff`) when the property is unset.
 *   - On the public chat surface, `PublicChatView` publishes
 *     the active persona's `siteCtaGlowColor` on its `.chatView`
 *     wrapper, so the rim + bloom flip with the active tick.
 *   - On the product hero (`ProductView` / `PageHero`), no value
 *     is published so the default violet paints — which matches
 *     the spec since the product page has no persona context.
 *
 * The button always navigates to `/login?tab=register`. There is
 * no `onClick` prop today because every consumer wants the same
 * destination; if a future surface needs a custom destination the
 * navigator + path can be lifted to props.
