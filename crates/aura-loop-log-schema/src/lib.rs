//! On-disk schema for dev-loop run bundles.
//!
//! This crate holds the serde types written by the server's
//! `loop_log` module and read by downstream consumers (CLI,
//! Debug UI, future `/summary` smart renderer). Keeping them in
//! a tiny shared crate avoids a circular dependency between the
//! server app and the analysis tooling.
