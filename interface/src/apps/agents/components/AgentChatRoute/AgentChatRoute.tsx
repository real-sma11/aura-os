/**
 * Route element shared by `/agents/:agentId` and
 * `/projects/:projectId/agents/:agentInstanceId`.
 *
 * The agent chat is no longer rendered here. It lives in the shell-level
 * `ConversationSurfaceHost`, a single persistent surface keyed by conversation
 * lane so switching between the Agents and Projects apps on the same
 * agent/session never remounts the chat. This element therefore renders
 * nothing — its only job is to make the route match so the host (which derives
 * the target from the URL) takes over while the app's `MainPanel` wraps an
 * empty outlet.
 *
 * It does own one piece of routing logic: stale-agent recovery for the
 * standalone `/agents/:agentId` form. A cached last-agent id that belongs to a
 * different (logged-out) user, a deleted agent, or a dead deep link would
 * otherwise strand the user on `/agents/<deadId>` — an unhighlighted sidebar
 * and an empty "Select an agent" sidekick that reads as "no agent is
 * selected". When the fleet has loaded and the id doesn't resolve, we bounce
 * back to `/agents` so `AgentIndexRedirect` clears the stale id and selects a
 * real agent.
