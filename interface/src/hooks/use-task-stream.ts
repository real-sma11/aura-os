/**
 * Selects a live task stream slice by `taskId`.
 *
 * All WS event subscriptions for tasks are registered once at app boot
 * by `bootstrapTaskStreamSubscriptions` (see
 * `interface/src/stores/task-stream-bootstrap.ts`). This hook no longer
 * registers its own subscribers — that approach raced with the first
 * batch of events arriving immediately after `TaskStarted` and led to
 * a task row whose body never filled in. The app-scoped subscriptions
 * are in place before the first component mounts, so every task event
 * lands in the stream store regardless of render timing.
 *
 * When `isActive` is `true`, the entry is pre-created and
 * `isStreaming` is set synchronously on mount so consumers can read
 * the live phase label immediately when the route re-renders a run
 * that is already in progress, instead of waiting for the next
 * `TaskStarted` event to arrive.
