 * consistent:
 *
 *  - `headerOutline` and `headerBackground` each suppress the accent
 *    stripe; whichever of those is set "owns" the row's visual
 *    treatment and stacking a stripe on top would just add noise.
 *  - When no chip styling is configured at all, `headerStyle` is
 *    `undefined` (rather than an empty object) so React's diff
 *    doesn't tag every render as a style change.
 *
 * The stripe is painted by `.projectHeader::before` in
 * `LeftMenuTree.module.css`; we just expose its color here via a
 * `--accent-stripe-color` CSS custom property. Pseudo-element
 * painting bypasses the row's 6px border-radius clip so the stripe
 * stays straight top-to-bottom (inset by the radius amount).
