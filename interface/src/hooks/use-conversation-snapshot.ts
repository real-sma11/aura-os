/**
 * Single-frame projection of the chat transcript from the persisted
 * history snapshot and the live stream events into the canonical
 * ordered `messages` array consumed by `ChatPanel`/`ChatMessageList`.
 *
 * Phase B of the bottoms-up refactor reduced this from a 525-line merge
 * with anchor rules + a `reinstateMissingPersistedOnSend` backstop +
 * a `lastNonEmptyRef` empty-frame cache to a thin call into the pure
 * `projectConversation` projector. The hacks went away because the
 * upstream stream handlers now stamp every message with a stable
 * `clientId` (see `attachment-helpers.buildUserChatMessage` and
 * `stream/handlers/lifecycle.handleEventSaved`), so React keys stay
 * pinned across the placeholder -> persisted-id swap and the merge
 * never has to chase an inconsistent id.
 *
 * The `setThread` effect still bridges history into the message-store
 * for the older snapshot consumers (`use-load-older-messages`,
 * `useOnboardingTaskWatcher`); the projector itself has no dependency
 * on the message-store and reads `historyMessages` directly.
