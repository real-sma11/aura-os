/**
 * Streams `text` one character at a time, mimicking the way LLM
 * responses arrive token-by-token in real chat UIs. While the stream
 * is still progressing a small block caret hangs off the trailing
 * edge of the visible prefix so the bubble reads as "actively being
 * written" rather than truncated; once the full text is on screen
 * the caret disappears.
 *
 * `setInterval` (rather than chained `setTimeout`s) drives the
 * reveal so a single test-time `vi.advanceTimersByTime(N)` flushes
 * the entire stream — chained timeouts only progress one character
 * per `act()` flush because React can't schedule the next timer
 * until the prior state update is committed, which would force every
 * test that touches a message bubble to loop one-tick-at-a-time.
 *
 * `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` does NOT short-circuit the
 * stream. The only current consumer is the `MockAuraApp` hero (via
 * its DM windows), which is entirely decorative and whose
 * surrounding timeline is explicitly designed to play even under
 * reduced motion (see the mock app file comment); pinning the
 * message text to "appear instantly" for reduced-motion users made
 * the demo read as broken — the typing dots would vanish and the
 * full message would already be sitting in the bubble, with no
 * sense of "the agent just replied". A future non-decorative
 * consumer should add its own reduced-motion gate at the callsite
 * rather than relying on this one.
