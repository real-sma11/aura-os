/**
 * Behavioural test for the looping `AgentDemoBanner`. Pins three
 * contracts that protect both the visual hero on the public homepage
 * and the accessibility behaviour around the decorative animation:
 *
 *   1. The banner mounts empty — the scripted timeline drives in via
 *      `setTimeout`, not eager render — so the first paint never
 *      flashes a fully-populated hero before the animation begins.
 *   2. As fake timers advance, scripted frames fill in one at a time;
 *      the architect's first message lands within the first ~1s of
 *      simulated time, demonstrating that the script playback is
 *      wired to a cancellable `setTimeout` chain rather than a
 *      non-cancellable interval.
 *   3. The decorative agent loop inside the banner is `aria-hidden`
 *      so screen readers ignore the looping animation and the chat
 *      input below stays the keyboard-reachable surface. The
 *      marketing title at the top of the banner is intentionally
 *      NOT `aria-hidden` so the tagline reaches assistive tech.
 *
 * `prefers-reduced-motion` is intentionally NOT short-circuited at
 * the JS layer (the demo is the entire point of the hero, so freezing
 * it leaves no information value). The CSS layer disables the
 * per-row slide-in and typing-dot pulse under that media query —
 * unit-testing CSS media queries is out of scope for vitest, so we
 * stub `matchMedia` to a non-matching default and let CSS handle the
 * rest in production.
