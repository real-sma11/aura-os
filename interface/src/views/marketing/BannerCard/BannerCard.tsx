/**
 * Reusable outer chrome for marketing "banner" surfaces — a single
 * elevated card sitting one notch above the off-black
 * `--marketing-section-bg` (`#0f0f12`) page surface.
 *
 * Owns three things and nothing else:
 *   1. Surface — `#141417` base with a top-down white wash gradient
 *      so the card reads as one notch lighter than the section bg
 *      without introducing a new shade.
 *   2. Elevation — soft drop shadow modeled on the landing-page
 *      `MockAuraApp` desktop card, trimmed down for smaller cards.
 *   3. Spacing — 28px/32px padding (22px on narrow viewports) and a
 *      28px (22px on narrow) flex-column gap between direct
 *      children, so consumers can drop a `<header>` + `<body>` pair
 *      in without re-declaring the rhythm.
 *
 * Intentionally has SQUARE corners and NO border — the marketing
 * surface treats banner cards as full-width slabs rather than
 * pill-shaped tiles, which is what the `/changelog` summary card
 * was redesigned around.
 *
 * Internal layout (grids, halos, etc.) lives on the children — see
 * `.changelogStatsCardBody` in `ChangelogView.css` for the prior
 * art the chrome here was lifted from.
