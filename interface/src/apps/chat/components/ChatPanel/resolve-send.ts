 * reference an `action`.
 *
 * 3D mode is a two-step pipeline: a `3d_image_step` runs an
 * AURA-styled image generation when the input bar has no source thumb
 * pinned; a `3d_model_step` runs the image-to-3D conversion against
 * the pinned image when one exists. The split is the source of truth
 * for `useChatStream` / `useAgentChatStream` to choose between
 * `generateImageStream` (with `STYLE_LOCK_SUFFIX` appended) and
