//! Bounded `(TaskId, version)`-keyed cache for [`super::TaskContext`]
//! payloads.
//!
//! The cache is intentionally simple: a `Mutex<IndexMap<...>>` where
//! the insertion order doubles as the eviction order. We do not need
//! true LRU semantics because the call site is always "an agent
//! turn just asked for one task's context" — the working set is
//! tiny (a handful of tasks per run). Capping at
//! [`MAX_CACHE_ENTRIES`] is enough to prevent unbounded growth on a
//! long-lived server while keeping the hot keys resident.
//!
//! Versioning is supplied by the caller (typically the storage row's
//! `updated_at` timestamp folded into a `u64`); a bump on the
//! underlying task automatically invalidates the cache because the
//! key changes.
