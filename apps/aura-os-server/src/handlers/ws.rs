//! `/ws/events` forwarder. Subscribes to the sequenced
//! [`crate::event_log::EventLog`] (fed from the legacy
//! `event_broadcast` channel) and pushes each JSON event to the
//! connected client as a text frame, stamped with its monotonic `seq`.
//!
//! Reconnect support: clients pass `?since=<seq>` to ask for everything
//! they missed. The handler replays the buffered backlog before
//! switching to live streaming. If the requested backlog was already
//! evicted from the ring, the handler emits a single
//! `{"type":"ws_resync_required","last_seq":N}` frame so the client can
//! drop its stale view and rehydrate via HTTP snapshots.
//!
//! All logs in this module use `target: "aura::ws"` so the diagnostic
//! story can grep on a single tracing target across publisher
//! (`event_bus.rs`) and forwarder (here).
