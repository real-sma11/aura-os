//! Agent permission primitives for aura-os.
//!
//! Mirrors `aura_core::permissions` in the `aura-harness` repo so the
//! rest of the aura-os workspace can import [`AgentPermissions`],
//! [`AgentScope`], and [`Capability`] from a single local path.
//!
//! # Choice of duplication over re-export
//!
//! The authoritative definitions live in `aura-harness` but that crate
//! is not a dependency of this workspace — [`aura_protocol`] carries a
//! wire-compatible mirror (`AgentPermissionsWire` etc.) used by
//! `SessionInit`. We keep a full native mirror here rather than using
//! the wire types directly so aura-os business code can manipulate
//! `Vec<Capability>` without going through `serde_json`, and so the
//! `Agent` struct remains free of wire-level concerns. Conversions to
//! and from the wire shape are `From` impls below and are used
//! wherever aura-os talks to the harness (e.g. `SessionConfig`).
//!
//! The serde representation is byte-identical to
//! `aura_protocol::AgentPermissionsWire`, so JSON round-trips between
//! the harness wire and this local type are transparent.
//!
//! TODO(Phase 7): collapse this native mirror into protocol/domain DTOs
//! once agent records no longer persist `AgentPermissions` directly.
