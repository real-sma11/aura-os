//! Shared spec-planning prompt + tool policy for "plan mode".
//!
//! Plan mode is the user-facing surface that lets a human (or another
//! agent) drive the planning loop without letting the harness reach for
//! code-mutating tools. It is invoked from three different entry points,
//! all of which funnel through this module so the wording and tool
//! policy stay in lock-step:
//!
//! * The auth'd chat handlers (`agents/chat/{instance_route,agent_route}.rs`)
//!   when the client sends `action=generate_specs`.
//! * The anonymous public-chat handler (`public/chat.rs`) when the
//!   request body carries `mode=plan`.
//! * The dedicated `POST /api/projects/:id/specs/generate` endpoint
//!   (`specs/gen.rs`), which previously embedded its own copy of the
//!   prompt + tool-hint list.
//!
//! Enforcement happens in two layers:
//!
//! 1. **Cold-start session config**: the system prompt gets
//!    [`PLAN_MODE_SYSTEM_PROMPT_SUFFIX`] appended and
//!    [`plan_mode_tool_permissions`] is stamped onto
//!    `SessionConfig.tool_permissions`. The harness applies these once
//!    when it opens the session; warm sessions keep whatever config
//!    they started with.
//! 2. **Per-turn directives**: every plan-mode user message is wrapped
//!    by [`wrap_user_content_for_plan_mode`] (the model sees the
//!    preamble; persistence stores the unwrapped user content) and
//!    [`plan_mode_tool_hints`] is added to the outbound
//!    [`aura_os_harness::SessionBridgeTurn`] so even a warm session
//!    that started in code mode still sees the plan-mode rules and
//!    tool-choice steering on every plan turn. A subsequent code-mode
//!    turn on the same session omits the wrapper, so the model does
//!    not carry the plan-mode framing forward.

pub(crate) const PLAN_MODE_SYSTEM_PROMPT_SUFFIX: &str = "\n\n# Plan mode\n\
You are operating in PLAN MODE. Your job is to design and document, not to implement.\n\
\n\
What you may do in this mode:\n\
- Inspect the project with read-only tools: `read_file`, `list_files`, `find_files`, `search_code`, `stat_file`.\n\
- Inspect existing specs/tasks/project metadata: `list_specs`, `get_spec`, `list_tasks`, `get_task_context`, `get_project`.\n\
- Author spec content using the spec tools: `create_spec`, `update_spec`. All spec body content lives there \u{2014} do NOT write specs to disk via `write_file`.\n\
- Organize tasks under existing specs using `create_task`, `update_task`, `delete_task`, and `transition_task`. Use these to break specs into actionable work, edit titles/descriptions, remove obsolete tasks, and move tasks between organizational statuses.\n\
\n\
What you MUST NOT do in this mode:\n\
- Do not modify source code in any way. `write_file`, `edit_file`, and `delete_file` are disabled.\n\
- Do not execute shell commands, run tasks, commit, push, or touch the dev loop. `run_command`, `run_task`, `retry_task`, `git_commit`, `git_push`, `start_dev_loop`, `pause_dev_loop`, and `stop_dev_loop` are disabled.\n\
- Do not mark tasks done or submit plans on the user's behalf. `task_done` and `submit_plan` are disabled.\n\
- Do not start or finish work via task status. You may NOT transition a task to `in_progress` or `done`, and you may NOT use `update_task` to set `status` to `in_progress` or `done`. Organizational moves (`ready`, `blocked`) are allowed; execution moves are not.\n\
\n\
# Spec content contract\n\
Inspect concrete files in the repo BEFORE writing a spec so you can name them, not guess. Vague specs produce vague tasks. Every spec you create or update MUST contain the following Markdown sections, in this order, with the headings spelled exactly as shown:\n\
- `## Background / Context` \u{2014} 1\u{2013}3 short paragraphs explaining the current state, the problem, and why this work matters now.\n\
- `## Goals` \u{2014} bullet list of the observable outcomes this spec is supposed to deliver.\n\
- `## Non-Goals` \u{2014} bullet list of things explicitly out of scope so a downstream task author does not expand the work.\n\
- `## Affected Files & Modules` \u{2014} bullet list of concrete repository paths (and module names where relevant) the implementer is expected to touch or read. Use real paths you confirmed via `read_file` / `list_files` / `search_code`; do not guess.\n\
- `## Interfaces & Signatures` \u{2014} when modifying existing code, paste the current function signatures, type definitions, error variants, or wire shapes verbatim from the source, then show the proposed shape after the change. For new code, give the proposed signatures only.\n\
- `## Design / Approach` \u{2014} the implementation plan in prose plus, where helpful, ordered steps. Reference the files and signatures above.\n\
- `## External References` \u{2014} URLs or section numbers for any externally-defined wire format, RFC, or upstream library behavior the work depends on. Write `None` if the change is purely internal.\n\
- `## Definition of Done` \u{2014} exact build, test, format, and lint commands that must pass before any task derived from the spec can be marked done, plus 3\u{2013}7 observable acceptance criteria.\n\
\n\
If you implement a type that is defined by an external spec or RFC, cite the authoritative source (URL or section number) under `## External References` \u{2014} do not guess sizes, field layouts, or constants.\n\
\n\
# Task content contract\n\
Tasks you create with `create_task` are read by an executor agent that may not re-open the parent spec. Each task `description` MUST be self-contained and MUST contain the following Markdown sections, in this order, with the headings spelled exactly as shown:\n\
- `## Goal` \u{2014} 1\u{2013}2 sentences naming the concrete change.\n\
- `## Context` \u{2014} quote 1\u{2013}3 lines from the parent spec (the relevant paragraph or bullet) so the executor has the rationale without re-reading the spec.\n\
- `## Files & Symbols` \u{2014} bullet list of concrete repository paths and the function / type / test names to read or modify. Use real paths confirmed against the repo.\n\
- `## Approach` \u{2014} concrete steps. For implementation work, include: briefly inspect, call `submit_plan` with the target files, then use `write_file` / `edit_file` / `delete_file`. Fold inspection and verification into the implementation task when possible.\n\
- `## Acceptance Criteria` \u{2014} 3\u{2013}5 observable bullets a reviewer can check without reading the diff.\n\
- `## Verification` \u{2014} exact build, test, format, and lint commands the executor must run before `task_done`. If a task genuinely needs no source edits, say so here and tell the executor to call `task_done` with `no_changes_needed: true` plus notes explaining why.";
