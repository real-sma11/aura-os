//! Shared spec-planning prompt + tool policy for "plan mode".
//!
//! Plan mode is the user-facing surface that lets a human (or another
//! agent) drive the planning loop without letting the harness reach for
//! code-mutating tools. It is invoked from three different entry points,
//! all of which funnel through this module so the wording and tool
//! policy stay in lock-step:
//!
//! * The auth'd chat handlers (`agents/chat/{instance_route,agent_route}.rs`)
//!   when the client sends `action=generate_specs`.
//! * The anonymous public-chat handler (`public/chat.rs`) when the
//!   request body carries `mode=plan`.
//! * The dedicated `POST /api/projects/:id/specs/generate` endpoint
//!   (`specs/gen.rs`), which previously embedded its own copy of the
//!   prompt + tool-hint list.
//!
//! Enforcement happens in two layers:
//!
//! 1. **Cold-start session config**: the system prompt gets
//!    [`PLAN_MODE_SYSTEM_PROMPT_SUFFIX`] appended and
//!    [`plan_mode_tool_permissions`] is stamped onto
//!    `SessionConfig.tool_permissions`. The harness applies these once
//!    when it opens the session; warm sessions keep whatever config
//!    they started with.
//! 2. **Per-turn directives**: every plan-mode user message is wrapped
//!    by [`wrap_user_content_for_plan_mode`] (the model sees the
//!    preamble; persistence stores the unwrapped user content) and
//!    [`plan_mode_tool_hints`] is added to the outbound
//!    [`aura_os_harness::SessionBridgeTurn`] so even a warm session
//!    that started in code mode still sees the plan-mode rules and
//!    tool-choice steering on every plan turn. A subsequent code-mode
//!    turn on the same session omits the wrapper, so the model does
//!    not carry the plan-mode framing forward.

You are operating in PLAN MODE. Your job is to design and document, not to implement.\n\
\n\
What you may do in this mode:\n\
- Inspect the project with read-only tools: `read_file`, `list_files`, `find_files`, `search_code`, `stat_file`.\n\
- Inspect existing specs/tasks/project metadata: `list_specs`, `get_spec`, `list_tasks`, `get_task_context`, `get_project`.\n\
- Author spec content using the spec tools: `create_spec`, `update_spec`. All spec body content lives there \u{2014} do NOT write specs to disk via `write_file`.\n\
\n\
What you MUST NOT do in this mode:\n\
- Do not modify source code in any way. `write_file`, `edit_file`, and `delete_file` are disabled.\n\
- Do not execute shell commands, run tasks, commit, push, or touch the dev loop. `run_command`, `run_task`, `retry_task`, `git_commit`, `git_push`, `start_dev_loop`, `pause_dev_loop`, and `stop_dev_loop` are disabled.\n\
- Do not mark tasks done or submit plans on the user's behalf. `task_done` and `submit_plan` are disabled.\n\
\n\
Every spec you create or update MUST end with a `## Definition of Done` section that lists the exact build, test, format, and lint commands that must pass before any task derived from the spec can be marked done, plus 3\u{2013}7 observable acceptance criteria.\n\
\n\
If you implement a type that is defined by an external spec or RFC, cite the authoritative source (URL or section number) in the spec itself \u{2014} do not guess sizes, field layouts, or constants.";
