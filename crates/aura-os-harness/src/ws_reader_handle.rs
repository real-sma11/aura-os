//! Owning handle for a live automaton [`HarnessSession`].
//!
//! Relocated out of the (now-removed) `automaton_client` transport in
//! the harness-unification refactor. The legacy handle wrapped a bare
//! `tokio::task::AbortHandle` over the `connect_event_stream` reader
//! task; the canonical [`crate::HarnessLink`] transport instead returns
//! a fully-wired [`HarnessSession`] (typed + raw broadcast senders plus
//! the `commands_tx` mpsc into the WS writer), so this handle simply
//! *owns* that session.
//!
//! Dropping the session drops its `commands_tx`, which ends the
//! ws-bridge writer task, which closes the WebSocket sink, which ends
//! the reader task and releases the harness's per-process WS-slot
//! permit. (See `crate::ws_bridge::spawn_ws_bridge`.) That is the exact
//! teardown the old `AbortHandle::abort()` achieved, expressed through
//! ownership instead of a detached task abort.
//!
//! Behaviour preserved from the legacy handle:
//! * [`cancel`](Self::cancel): explicit teardown for call sites that
//!   know the stream is no longer wanted (e.g. the `stop_loop` path).
//!   Takes the session out of the shared cell even when other clones
//!   are still alive, so the WS slot is released immediately.
//! * [`Drop`]: safety net so a handle dropped on the floor still tears
//!   down its session once the last clone goes away.
//! * Cloning is cheap (`Arc` over the inner cell); all clones share the
//!   same underlying session and it is only torn down when the last
//!   clone drops or any clone calls `cancel`. Every `cancel` is
//!   idempotent.
