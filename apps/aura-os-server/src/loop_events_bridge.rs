//! Bridge: forward [`aura_os_events::DomainEvent`] loop lifecycle and
//! activity events onto the legacy `event_broadcast` firehose as JSON.
//!
//! The existing `/ws/events` WebSocket implementation reads from
//! `AppState::event_broadcast` and streams JSON frames to the frontend.
//! New loop lifecycle events (`LoopOpened`, `LoopActivityChanged`,
//! `LoopEnded`) flow through `EventHub`, which is typed and topic-scoped.
//! This bridge subscribes to the hub (project- and instance-scoped —
//! we use `SubscriptionFilter::empty()` but match every event by using
//! a broad topic union via `Topic::AgentId` for each loop) and rebroadcasts
//! them as JSON so the existing frontend can consume them without a
//! protocol change. Once the frontend migrates to the typed hub over
//! a dedicated endpoint this bridge can be deleted.
//!
//! Invariants:
//! - The bridge must never block the hub. It uses a non-blocking
//!   `broadcast::Sender::send` which drops when no subscribers exist;
//!   that matches the existing behaviour for other producers.
//! - The bridge only emits loop-scoped variants. Other variants are
//!   published directly to both paths at their producer sites.
