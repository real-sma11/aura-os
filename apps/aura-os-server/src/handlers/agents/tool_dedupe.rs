//! Shared deduplication + diagnostic logging for harness
//! `installed_tools` lists.
//!
//! Every code path that constructs `Vec<InstalledTool>` and ships it to
//! the harness as part of `SessionInit` must funnel through
//! [`dedupe_and_log_installed_tools`] so the contract "no two tools in
//! the list share a `name`" is enforced in one place.
//!
//! The Anthropic Messages API rejects a whole request with
//! `400 Bad Request { "tools: Tool names must be unique." }` the moment
//! the same tool name appears twice. The harness forwards our
//! `installed_tools` into that `tools[]` array, so any duplicate that
//! slips through here lights up as an `invalid_request_error` on every
//! turn of the session.
//!
//! There are two independent sources of duplicates we defend against:
//!
//! 1. Server-side name collisions between workspace and integration
//!    tools. Handled by [`dedupe_installed_tools_by_name`].
//!
//! 2. Collisions between a tool the server ships in `installed_tools`
//!    and a native tool the external harness sidecar (`aura_node`)
//!    registers itself before forwarding to Anthropic. This repo
//!    doesn't host the sidecar; its source lives at
//!    `C:\code\aura-harness\crates\aura-tools\src\definitions.rs`.
//!    At session init the harness builds `tool_definitions` as
//!    `visible_tools(ToolProfile::Agent) + installed_tools` via a
//!    raw `push` (see `aura-harness/crates/aura-node/src/session/
//!    ws_handler.rs::populate_tool_definitions`) — NO dedupe — so any
//!    name we ship that also appears in the harness `Agent` profile
//!    round-trips to Anthropic twice. Handled by
//!    [`strip_harness_native_tool_names`].
//!
//! The `info!` emitted here gives us the full list the server actually
//! shipped, so when a 400 does occur we can tell from logs alone
//! whether the duplicate originated here or was added by something
//! downstream of us.
