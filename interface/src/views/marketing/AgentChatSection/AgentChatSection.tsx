/**
 * First themed section built on the shared marketing `<Section />`
 * shell. Mirrors the Apple iPhone 17 hero layout: a centered
 * headline at the top, three phones below it (the middle one
 * larger and lifted forward so it visually overlaps the two side
 * phones), and a writing block at the bottom.
 *
 * Each `PhoneShell` hosts a `MockMobileChat` — a live, looping
 * mobile chat mockup showing the visitor texting one of their AURA
 * agents (your prompts on the right, the agent's typed replies and
 * streamed tool cards on the left). The three phones run three
 * distinct conversation flows from `MOBILE_CONVERSATIONS`, each
 * looping independently, mirroring the desktop landing hero but in
 * a phone-shaped messaging layout.
 *
 * On narrow viewports (<= 768px) `AgentChatSection.css` hides the
 * two side phones so only the centered hero phone remains, which
 * keeps the section legible on mobile without trying to squeeze a
 * desktop-style 3-phone row into a phone width.
