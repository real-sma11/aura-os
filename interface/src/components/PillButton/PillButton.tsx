/**
 * PillButton renders a fully-rounded, accent-colored button with always-dark
 * text. It wraps the zui `Button` `filled` variant and locks the shape so
 * every shell that wants an accent call-to-action (titlebar update prompt,
 * login CTAs, etc.) shares the same affordance.
 *
 * Notes:
 * - zui's `--radius-full` token resolves to `0` in this project, so the pill
 *   shape is enforced via an explicit `9999px` radius in the local CSS module
 *   rather than relying on `rounded="full"`.
 * - Text color is hard-pinned to a dark value so the pill stays legible
 *   regardless of accent (some accents like purple/blue/rose otherwise
 *   resolve `--color-accent-contrast` to white).
 * - `dimUnselected={false}` opts out of zui's hover-dim treatment for
 *   non-selected buttons; without it the pill would fade to 60% opacity on
 *   hover, which fights the accent-darkening hover state below. With the
 *   dim removed the pill sits at the full `--color-accent` at rest and
 *   hover darkens to `--color-accent-hover` via zui's built-in
 *   `.filled:hover` rule (every theme defines its hover token as a darker
 *   shade of the base accent).
