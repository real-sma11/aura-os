# Render Deployment — aura-os

Production is split across two Render services: `aura-api` runs the Rust API,
and `aura-app` builds/serves the static interface. Secrets used for provider
calls belong on `aura-api`, never on the static frontend.

## Render Service Setup

| Service | Type | Responsibility |
|---------|------|----------------|
| `aura-api` | Docker Web Service | Builds and runs `aura-os-server` plus its managed Chromium runtime at `https://api.aura.ai` |
| `aura-app` | Static Site | Builds `interface/` and publishes `interface/dist` |

Both services deploy `main`. Keep the actual Render build/start commands in
sync with the corresponding service settings; Render remains the operational
source of truth.

## Environment Variables

### `aura-api` required

| Variable | Value |
|----------|-------|
| `AURA_SERVER_PORT` | `10000` |
| `AURA_SERVER_HOST` | `0.0.0.0` |
| `AURA_SERVER_BASE_URL` | `https://api.aura.ai` |
| `AURA_ROUTER_URL` | `https://aura-router.onrender.com` |
| `Z_BILLING_URL` | `https://z-billing.onrender.com` |
| `BRAVE_SEARCH_PLATFORM_KEY` | Aura's Brave Search subscription key (secret) |
| `BROWSER_EXECUTABLE_PATH` | Leave unset or set to `/usr/bin/chromium`. The production Dockerfile supplies this value. Remove stale host-specific overrides. |

`BRAVE_SEARCH_PLATFORM_KEY` must exist only on `aura-api`. Do not add it to
`aura-app`, any `VITE_*` variable, GitHub Actions desktop secrets, or renderer
configuration.

### `aura-app` required

| Variable | Value |
|----------|-------|
| `VITE_API_URL` | `https://api.aura.ai` |

The static frontend receives only the public API origin. It never calls Brave
directly.

### Optional overrides

| Variable | Value |
|----------|-------|
| `VITE_API_URL` on `aura-api` | Optional fallback for `AURA_SERVER_BASE_URL`; prefer the explicit server variable in the split deployment. |

### Recommended (full functionality)

| Variable | Value |
|----------|-------|
| `AURA_NETWORK_URL` | `https://aura-network.onrender.com` |
| `AURA_STORAGE_URL` | `https://aura-storage.onrender.com` |
| `AURA_INTEGRATIONS_URL` | `https://aura-integrations.onrender.com` |
| `AURA_INTEGRATIONS_INTERNAL_TOKEN` | Must match `INTERNAL_SERVICE_TOKEN` on `aura-integrations` |
| `ORBIT_BASE_URL` | `https://orbit-sfvu.onrender.com` |
| `MIXPANEL_TOKEN` | Mixpanel project token. Enables **server-side** analytics (`session_active` True DAU backstop + share events). The server logs a loud warning at startup if unset. |
| `VITE_MIXPANEL_TOKEN` | Same Mixpanel token, consumed by the Vite build so the **web client** SDK sends engagement events. Without it the browser SDK silently no-ops. |

Aura sends `BRAVE_SEARCH_PLATFORM_KEY` to Brave as the Search API credential.
No additional Render variable or xAI/X integration is involved.

Packaged desktop builds default `AURA_PLATFORM_TOOL_ACTION_BASE_URL` to
`https://api.aura.ai`. A GitHub environment/repository variable is only needed
to override that public callback origin; the Brave key remains server-side.

`APP_VERSION` in the build command stamps a real clean version into the bundle so analytics events are not bucketed under `app_version = "0.0.0"` or a `*-dirty` git fallback. `RENDER_GIT_COMMIT` is provided automatically by Render. It is `export`ed (not set inline on `npm run build` only) so both Vite and the analytics validator see it.

Analytics-enabled Vite builds and the `desktop-frontend-assets-validate.mjs --require-analytics` step **fail the build** if `VITE_MIXPANEL_TOKEN` is missing/empty or was not actually inlined into the bundle, or if `APP_VERSION` is empty/`0.0.0`/`*-dirty`. This is the web equivalent of the desktop release guard — a config regression that would silently ship a no-op or mis-versioned web analytics SDK now breaks the deploy loudly instead of going unnoticed. `VITE_MIXPANEL_TOKEN` must be present in the Render service env (above) for it to pass.

> **Apply on the Render dashboard:** add `BRAVE_SEARCH_PLATFORM_KEY` to
> `aura-api`, then redeploy that service. No `aura-app` redeploy is required for
> the secret itself.

### Optional

| Variable | Value |
|----------|-------|
| `REQUIRE_ZERO_PRO` | `true` (default) or `false` |
| `SWARM_BASE_URL` | Swarm gateway URL if using remote agents |
| `LOCAL_HARNESS_URL` | Hosted harness URL when web should support `machine_type: "local"` agents through a separately deployed harness service. Leave unset for remote-only Render deployments. |
| `LOCAL_HARNESS_AUTH_TOKEN` | Shared transport bearer for a hosted harness. Must match that harness service's `AURA_NODE_AUTH_TOKEN`; leave unset unless `LOCAL_HARNESS_URL` points at a protected hosted harness. |

### Hosted local harness

Aura web can run local-agent traffic through a separately deployed harness
service instead of a loopback sidecar. Configure the two services as a pair:

| Service | Variable | Value |
|---------|----------|-------|
| aura-os web service | `LOCAL_HARNESS_URL` | `https://YOUR-HARNESS-SERVICE.onrender.com` |
| aura-os web service | `LOCAL_HARNESS_AUTH_TOKEN` | Shared secret value |
| aura-os web service | `AURA_DISABLE_LOCAL_HARNESS_AUTOSPAWN` | `1` |
| aura-os web service | `AURA_REMOTE_ONLY` | unset / `false` when local-agent chat or dev-loop should use the hosted harness |
| harness image service | `AURA_NODE_REQUIRE_AUTH` | `1` |
| harness image service | `AURA_NODE_AUTH_TOKEN` | Same shared secret value |
| harness image service | `AURA_OS_SERVER_URL` | Public aura-os web service URL |
| harness image service | `AURA_DATA_DIR` | A writable persistent-disk mount, for example `/data` |

`LOCAL_HARNESS_AUTH_TOKEN` authenticates only the server-to-harness transport.
The signed-in user's JWT still travels inside `RuntimeRequest.auth_jwt`, and
must not be replaced with the harness shared secret.

The two services have separate filesystems. Aura resolves every runtime
workspace through the hosted harness and must not pass the aura-os web
service's local `data_dir/workspaces/...` path to it. The harness service's
`/workspace/resolve` response is authoritative for chat, project-tool, and
dev-loop execution. Aura uses the immutable project UUID as the hosted
workspace key; do not replace it with the project name, because normalized
names can collide and names change over time.

Attach a persistent disk to the harness service at the directory configured by
`AURA_DATA_DIR`. The container image creates a writable `/data` directory, but
without a persistent Render disk every deploy/restart discards hosted-local
project files. Imported browser files are copied to the protected
`POST /workspace/import` endpoint, and project deletion performs best-effort
cleanup through `DELETE /workspace/:project_id`; deploy the matching Harness
build before the aura-api build that starts calling those lifecycle endpoints.

Safe Workspace uses capability negotiation because its Git worktrees must be
created by the service that owns the files. The hosted Harness advertises
`safe_workspace: true` from `/health` and owns the protected
`/workspace/:project_id/safe/:session_id/...` lifecycle. Aura API exposes the
control only after that capability is present; a missing field, failed probe,
or older Harness keeps the control hidden and rejects direct opt-in requests.
For this feature, deploy Aura API first (it fails closed against the older
Harness), then deploy Harness. This avoids a window where an older Aura API
exposes a control it cannot proxy.

The browser file explorer and interactive terminal remain unavailable for
hosted-local workspaces. Their existing local routes execute on aura-api's
filesystem, while Harness's terminal currently opens a service-level home
directory rather than a project sandbox. Do not proxy either surface as if it
were desktop-local. Agent file and command tools do execute inside the hosted
project workspace. When Safe Workspace is active, the parent run and all of its
spawned child agents receive the same isolated session path; child-agent
dispatch semantics are otherwise unchanged. The opt-in aura-api workspace
health gate is also skipped
for hosted-local and Swarm workspaces because aura-api cannot run `cargo check`
inside another service's filesystem.

Existing Git URLs are metadata today; the Harness run path forwards them but
does not bootstrap an empty hosted workspace by cloning. Use the browser file
import for an existing codebase, or let the agent create a new project in its
UUID workspace. Adding authenticated Git bootstrap requires a separate,
kernel-mediated design so repository credentials are not exposed to a shared
service-level process.

If an earlier experimental hosted-local build already created name-slug
directories, review and migrate them manually. Automatic slug-to-UUID moves
are intentionally unsafe on a shared Harness because a slug may already
contain files from more than one same-named project.

Do not enable `AURA_REMOTE_ONLY=1` for this mode. Remote-only deployments reject
local-agent chat/dev-loop routes before they reach the hosted local harness.

## Prerequisites

1. **Vendored ZUI** — Aura now vendors `@cypher-asi/zui` under `vendor/zui`, and `interface/package.json` resolves it from inside this repo. Render builds no longer need a sibling checkout or a separately published ZUI package.

2. **Local storage model** — Aura no longer depends on the old embedded C++ database layer. Browser-owned persistence lives in IndexedDB, while the local backend uses a lightweight JSON/runtime store.

3. **Preview browser** — Deploy `aura-api` from the repository-root
   `Dockerfile`, not Render's native Rust runtime. The image installs Debian's
   Chromium package, runs the API as a non-root user, and sets
   `BROWSER_EXECUTABLE_PATH=/usr/bin/chromium`. Normal `dev-channel` and
   `stable-channel` server builds include the CDP backend.

   The image also sets `AURA_BROWSER_STARTUP_PROBE=1`. On every container
   start the server launches Chromium, opens and closes a blank page over CDP,
   and exits before binding the API port if that check fails. This lets Render
   reject or roll back a broken deployment before users discover it in
   Preview.

   Standard Docker/Render security profiles do not grant the namespace
   capabilities Chromium's inner Linux sandbox requires. The image therefore
   sets `BROWSER_DISABLE_SANDBOX=1`; the non-root container is the browser's
   isolation boundary. Do not use this image as a shared host process or add
   host mounts containing secrets. If Preview eventually moves into a
   dedicated browser sidecar, remove this override there once that runtime can
   provide Chromium-compatible namespaces.

### Migrating `aura-api` to the managed browser image

1. Configure the existing `aura-api` Web Service to build the root
   `Dockerfile` from `main`. Keep the service URL, environment variables,
   health check, and instance count unchanged.
2. Remove any Windows/macOS or otherwise stale `BROWSER_EXECUTABLE_PATH`
   override from the Render environment. The image default is
   `/usr/bin/chromium`; an explicit Render value must match it.
3. Deploy the candidate image and require the log line
   `browser: startup Chromium/CDP probe succeeded` before promoting it.
4. Sign in to AURA Web, open Preview, load a page, and verify both a rendered
   frame and Design-mode element selection.

Rollback is the previous `aura-api` image/configuration. Because `aura-app`
is a separate static service, this migration does not change its build or
assets.

## Post-Deploy Verification

```bash
# Health check (should return 401 — no auth)
curl https://api.aura.ai/api/auth/session

# Login
curl -X POST https://api.aura.ai/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"...","password":"..."}'

# Frontend loads
open https://YOUR-AURA-APP-DOMAIN
```

The API container's startup log must include:

```text
browser: startup Chromium/CDP probe succeeded
```

After signing in, start a chat and ask for current information. Verify the
assistant invokes Web Search without a connect step. Then inspect `aura-api`
logs for a successful Brave response and confirm the browser network request is
to `https://api.aura.ai/api/orgs/.../tool-actions/brave_search_*`, never to
Brave directly.

## Notes

- Port 10000 is Render's default. The server reads `AURA_SERVER_PORT`.
- Host `0.0.0.0` is required — Render rejects `127.0.0.1` bindings.
- `AURA_SERVER_BASE_URL` is the API's own public URL. It is stamped into cross-agent tool endpoints (`send_to_agent`, `spawn_agent`, etc.) so the remote harness / `aura-swarm` can call back in. Without it the server falls back to `http://<AURA_SERVER_HOST>:<AURA_SERVER_PORT>`, and `0.0.0.0` is normalized to `127.0.0.1` — which is unreachable from any other host.
- Keep `aura-api` at one instance with autoscaling disabled while Web Search quotas use the in-process limiter. Adding API instances multiplies the effective allowance, and a deploy/restart resets counters. Move counters to shared storage or z-billing before scaling horizontally or relying on the limits as a strict accounting ledger.
- Render instances still have ephemeral local disk. Browser-owned persisted state remains in the browser, server auth uses the in-memory validation cache, and any local backend compatibility state should be treated as rebuildable.
- The build takes ~2-3 minutes (Node frontend + Rust backend).
- `LOCAL_HARNESS_URL` should NOT be set on Render unless a harness service is deployed alongside and protected with the matching token pair above.
- Keep the hosted Harness at one instance unless its workspace disk is shared. Multiple independent instances can route consecutive turns for one project to different filesystems.

## Troubleshooting

- `external tool callback unreachable: http://127.0.0.1:<port>/...` — `aura-api` is handing remote harnesses a loopback URL. Set `AURA_SERVER_BASE_URL=https://api.aura.ai` on `aura-api` and redeploy.
- `Kernel error: create workspace: Permission denied` with an aura-api path such as `/opt/render/.local/share/aura-dev/workspaces/...` — aura-api is forwarding its own filesystem path to a separately hosted harness. Deploy a build that resolves hosted-local workspaces through `/workspace/resolve`, and verify the harness service's data directory is writable.
- `platform web search is not configured` — add `BRAVE_SEARCH_PLATFORM_KEY` to `aura-api`, not `aura-app`, and redeploy `aura-api`.
- Desktop Web Search callback points at loopback — set the GitHub variable `AURA_PLATFORM_TOOL_ACTION_BASE_URL=https://api.aura.ai` and publish a new desktop build. No Brave key belongs in that build.

## Orbit ENOSPC runbook

Symptom: users see repeated push failures whose reason text contains

```
remote: fatal: write error: No space left on device
error: remote unpack failed: index-pack abnormal exit
error: RPC failed; curl 18 transfer closed with outstanding read data remaining
```

This is orbit (`ORBIT_BASE_URL`, typically `https://orbit-sfvu.onrender.com`)
reporting that its local filesystem is full. The aura-os-server classifies
this as `remote_storage_exhausted` (see `classify_push_failure` in
`apps/aura-os-server/src/handlers/dev_loop.rs`) and, starting with the orbit
capacity guard:

1. Trips `OrbitCapacityGuard` for the configured `ORBIT_BASE_URL` so
   retries are annotated with a cooldown window instead of silently piling
   more `tmp_pack_*` objects onto orbit's already-full rootfs.
2. Emits a `push_deferred` + `project_push_stuck` event carrying
   `class: "remote_storage_exhausted"`, a remediation string, and
   `retry_after_secs`. The UI renders a dedicated "Orbit out of disk"
   status (amber dot on the Orbit indicator, banner on the project
   header, and a class-specific row on the task card).

### Diagnosis

```bash
# 1. Confirm the orbit service is live (health endpoint is unauth'd).
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" "$ORBIT_BASE_URL/health"
# Expect 2xx; a timeout or 5xx suggests orbit itself is down, not ENOSPC.

# 2. Inspect orbit's disk usage through the Render dashboard
#    (Service → Metrics → Disk). Note that Render surfaces the
#    *persistent disk* only; pack indexing happens on the ephemeral
#    rootfs so 0% persistent disk usage does NOT mean orbit has space.

# 3. Shell into the orbit service (Render → Shell) and run:
df -h /                          # ephemeral rootfs usage
du -sh /path/to/orbit/repos/*    # per-repo size
find /path/to/orbit/repos -type d -name 'tmp_pack_*' | xargs -r du -sh
```

### Operator action (on the orbit Render service)

1. Remove stale quarantine / `tmp_pack_*` directories left behind by
   earlier failed pushes:

   ```bash
   find /path/to/orbit/repos -type d \
     \( -name 'tmp_pack_*' -o -path '*/objects/incoming-*' \) \
     -mmin +10 -print -exec rm -rf {} +
   ```

2. Run `git gc --prune=now` inside affected repos to drop unreferenced
   loose objects.
3. If disk usage stays high, upgrade the Render plan — the ephemeral
   rootfs scales with instance tier.

Once space is freed, the *next* successful push from aura-os
automatically clears the guard (`git_pushed` handler calls
`OrbitCapacityGuard::clear`) and restores the Orbit indicator to
green.

### Cooldown tuning

The guard's window is controlled by `AURA_ORBIT_ENOSPC_COOLDOWN_SECS`
on the aura-os-server side (default 900s / 15 minutes). Setting it to
`0` disables the cooldown entirely — use only for integration tests
that need to hammer orbit on purpose.
